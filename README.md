====

Some scripts to find binary stars with common proper motion.

Use
---
The scripts are intended to be used in the following order:
* extcol.py - Extract the columns of interest from the catalog received as a text file generated by Topcat.
* zoneshm.py - Generate a heat map showing the density of objects by the zones defined to process the catalog.
* extzone.py - Get the data for a specific zone and so avoiding the processing of a unique and large file.
* findcpmb.py - Find the stars that matches the criteria for common proper motion.
* convout.py - Convert the RA and DEC values from decimal to hour and sexagesimal respectively.
* wdsmatch.py - Determine if any of the pairs found are in the WDS catalog.
